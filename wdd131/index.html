                <p>Hello, my name is Daniel Alejandro Alvarez Zuñiga. I am from Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia. Recently, the groundbreaking ceremony was held for the construction of a temple here in my city. I am very happy about this, as is my family. At BYUI, I am studying computer programming, but I am also studying business administration at a university here in my city. I enjoy playing soccer, which is a very popular sport in my city. I have a cat named "Gati" and I served a mission in Uruguay - Montevideo.</p>

                <p>Santa Cruz de la Sierra, commonly known as Santa Cruz, is the largest city in Bolivia and the capital of the Santa Cruz department. Situated on the Pirai River in the eastern Tropical Lowlands of Bolivia, the Santa Cruz de la Sierra Metropolitan Region is the most populous urban agglomeration in Bolivia with an estimated population of 3 million, The city was first founded in 1561 by Spanish explorer Ñuflo de Chavez about 200 km (124 mi) east of its current location, and was moved several times until it was finally established on the Pirai River in the late 16th century. Santa Cruz is Bolivia's most populous city, produces nearly 35% of Bolivia's gross domestic product, and receives over 40% of all foreign direct investment in the country. The city is the most important business center in Bolivia and the country's principal destination for national and international migrants.</p>
